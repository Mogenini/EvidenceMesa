Project Overview:
This project simulates a working city environment using a multi-agent model. 
Some of the features are: 
Collision Detection: Car agents can 
Traffic flow: Agents navigate the city while adhering to defined directions of streets.
Collisions: Simulation of possible collisions between agents, highlighting traffic behavior and potential risks.
Semaphores: Integration of traffic lights to control flow and simulate real-world street regulation.
The goal is to create a realistic and functional simulation of urban dynamics that can be used for educational, analytical, or research purposes.

Key Features:
Agent-Based Modeling:
Different agents represent vehicles, pedestrians, and other city entities, each with distinct behaviors and decision-making processes.

Grid System:
A grid-based representation of the city, with designated areas for parking, streets, and intersections.

Collision Detection:
Real-time collision detection between agents to simulate accidents or blocked pathways.

Traffic Control:
Semaphores regulate traffic flow, emulating real-world signal systems.

Dynamic Directions:
Streets have predefined directions, influencing agent movement and creating realistic traffic scenarios.

How It Works:
The simulation initializes with a set of agents, each assigned a starting and ending position. Vehicles can either start in a parking lot or on the streets. Traffic lights and street directions guide their movement, and collision mechanisms handle potential interactions between agents.

The simulation is powered by a grid-based system, where agents interact with predefined properties such as parking areas and traffic signals.
