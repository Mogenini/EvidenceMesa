## Project Overview
This project simulates a working city environment using a multi-agent model. 

### Features  
- **Collision Detection**: Real-time detection of potential collisions between agents.  
- **Traffic Flow**: Agents navigate the city while adhering to predefined street directions.  
- **Collisions**: Simulates possible collisions between agents, highlighting traffic behavior and potential risks.  
- **Semaphores**: Integration of traffic lights to control flow and emulate real-world street regulation.

## Key Features

### **Agent-Based Modeling**  
- Different agents represent vehicles, pedestrians, and other city entities.  
- Each agent type has distinct behaviors and decision-making processes.

### **Grid System**  
- The city is represented as a grid with designated areas for parking, streets, and intersections.  

### **Collision Detection**  
- Real-time collision detection simulates accidents or blocked pathways.  

### **Traffic Control**  
- Traffic lights (semaphores) regulate the flow of agents, mimicking real-world systems.  

### **Dynamic Directions**  
- Streets have predefined one-way or two-way directions, influencing agent movement and creating realistic traffic scenarios.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**  
   - The simulation begins with a set of agents, each assigned starting and destination points.  
   - Vehicles can start either in a parking lot or on the streets.  

2. **Agent Movement**  
   - Agents navigate the grid, guided by traffic lights and street directions.  

3. **Collision Management**  
   - Collision mechanisms handle interactions between agents, simulating accidents or blocked paths.  

4. **City Elements**  
   - The simulation utilizes a grid-based system where agents interact with predefined properties such as parking areas, intersections, and traffic signals.
