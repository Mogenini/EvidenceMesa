## Project Overview:
This project simulates a working city environment using a multi-agent model. 
Some of the features are: 
Collision Detection: Car agents can avoid and depending on the situation and the movements that it will be doing after making a step. This also permit's us to maintain realism to the simulation, which helps us in understanding how a model and differnte types of agent work. 
Semaphores: Integration of traffic lights to control flow and simulate real-world street regulation.

The goal of this project is to learn about how we could program differente models and agents. 

## How the program works:

The simulation initializes with a set of agents, each assigned a starting and ending position. Vehicles can either start in a parking lot or on the streets. Traffic lights and street directions guide their movement, and collision mechanisms handle potential interactions between agents.

To run the program, please install all of the dependencies and to run the code use the following:

solara run app.py
